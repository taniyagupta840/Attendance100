Automation for scheduled zoom meetings.

### Features
* Automatically opens scheduled zoom meetings where schedule is saved in a csv file.

### Setup (for Windows)
1. Download & Install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.5/python-3.8.5.exe).
1. Fill the zoom meeting links in ```timetable.csv```.

### Notes
* It would be better if zoom application is logged in already so that it doesn't ask for login credentials on joining the link.
* ```timetable.csv``` column number 1 to 6 denote Monday to Saturday.
* Days where schedule is over early, should end with ```exit``` in ```timetable.csv```. (See timetable.csv for reference)

### Future
* Open to contributions & pull requests.
